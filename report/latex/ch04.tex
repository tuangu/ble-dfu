\section{Prototype}
This chapter describes in detail the design and implementation of a prototype 
firmware for a BLE-enabled device. It explains the overall architecture, the 
firmware update procedure as well as the required building blocks. 
Then, the following sections detail the implementation of each component 
in the firmware.
